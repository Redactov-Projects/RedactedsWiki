# Custom Animations

1. Create your animations in your favorite program for it. I'll use Blender.
2. Export your file in FBX format
3. Open `RSL` -> `Animations` folder in Unreal Engine
4. Move your file in Content Browser, where you opened the folder
5. In `Skeleton` choose `SK_Character_Skeleton` and uncheck `Import mesh`
6. Press `Import all` button

::: tip
Server Library is using animation asset name as name for animation to call. So, if you want to change name of your animation to call - rename the animation asset.
