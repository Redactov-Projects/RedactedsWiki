# Custom sounds (see warning)

::: warning

In fact, for custom sounds you need to own BRMK. After 1.2, Fluppi made some sound-related changes to the engine. That's why you can't include custom sound in game. I'm working to fix that. 

:::

1. Open in Content Browser `/RSL/Sounds` folder
2. Move your `.wav` file in Content Browser
3. Open this asset in Unreal Enigne and change in `Vizualization Mode` from `Disable` or `Restart` **to** `Play when Silent`
